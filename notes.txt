- The fundamental idea of a CONTAINERIZED STACK is to package an application and its dependencies into a single reusuable artifact, which can be instantiated reliably in
different environments.
- Docker is instruction-based, not requirement-based
- Once we have Dockerfile, we can compile it into a binary artifact called an image.
- Each Data Science project has many dependencies, and reproducibility is at the heart of the process
- Once the local Docker image and container are created, next publish it from our local Docker repository to 
AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry), done through ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy for you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.
- And ECR is the registry for Docker containers stored in ECS. We will be using ECS to push our Docker container to ECR.
- AWS Fargate:
    - Technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances. 
    - With Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers.
    -  This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing.
